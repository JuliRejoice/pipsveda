Our platform provides algorithmic trading bots (AlgoBots), curated educational courses, real-time trade signals through Telegram, and seamless payment gateways for smooth transactions. By accessing or using our services, you agree to abide by the following terms and conditions.

                        <h2>Summary of Terms & Services</h2>
                        <p>
                            PipsVeda offers a comprehensive ecosystem for traders, including automated trading solutions, training resources, and community engagement. Users are expected to use the platform responsibly and ethically.

                        <h3>1. AlgoBot Usage:</h3>
                        <p>
                            Our AlgoBots are built for educational and trading enhancement purposes. While they help automate strategies, you are responsible for monitoring bot performance and making trading decisions. PipsVeda is not liable for financial losses incurred due to bot actions.
                        </p>

                        <h3>2. Course Access:</h3>
                        <p>
                            Access to courses is granted upon successful payment. Users are prohibited from redistributing or sharing course material. PipsVeda reserves the right to revoke access for any misuse.
                        </p>

                        <h3>3. Telegram Community:</h3>
                        <p>
                            Our Telegram groups provide trade signals, market insights, and community discussions. Any abusive behavior, spamming, or unauthorized promotions will lead to immediate removal from the group.
                        </p>

                        <h3>4. Payment Policy:</h3>
                        <p>
                            All payments made through PipsVeda's platform are secure and processed through trusted gateways. Payments are non-refundable unless otherwise stated under a specific plan or promotional offer.
                        </p>

                        <h3>5. Data Privacy:</h3>
                        <p>
                            We collect only essential information (such as name, email, and payment details) for account creation and access to services. Your data is protected and not shared with third parties without consent.
                        </p>

                        <h3>6. Limitations of Liability:</h3>
                        <p>
                            While we strive to offer high-quality services, PipsVeda is not responsible for technical outages, third-party tool failures (like exchange APIs), or market volatility affecting user trades.
